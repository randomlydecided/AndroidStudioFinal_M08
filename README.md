This is a direct copy of my Android Studio Project "Adventurer's Guild". Load this into Android Studio and run.

The app will display a quest list, a completed quest list, an inventory, a leveling system with experience and ranks, as well as a basic profile and login system.
As of now, most of the systems are broken and the app manages navigation and little else.
